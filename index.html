        <p id="paragraph-1">Hi! My name is Patrick Dunn and I’m an aspiring Web Developer.</p>
        <p id="paragraph-1">If you had asked me four years ago what I wanted to do, I wouldn’t have said web development. The field wasn’t even on my radar screen. Four years ago I was a junior in college, studying Spanish and Economics. But a difficult personal situation blindsided me in the winter of 2016 and set me on a new path. While I initially wanted to drop out of college, I decided to persevere and graduate with my Spanish degree.</p>
        <p id="paragraph-1">I moved back home and worked as carpenter for 2 years while I figured out what was next. After I paid off my student loans I couldn’t ignore the call to adventure any longer. So I completed a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) Certificate and moved to Mexico.</p>
        <p id="paragraph-1">I lived in a bustling city called Querétaro for nine months. I rented a room from a family less than a mile from the University of Querétaro. I bought a motorcycle, took German classes, and began training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I traveled all around the Central Highlands and even spent 10 days crisscrossing the Yucatan Peninsula from Mérida to Bacalar. It was a wonderful time and I will cherish the memories of those nine months for the rest of my life.</p>
        <p id="paragraph-1">While teaching English in Mexico was exciting, it wasn’t a career. Some students were a joy to teach while others were not so much. I didn’t feel challenged. The pay, while plenty for a single man in his 20’s, wouldn’t support a family. I needed a change.</p>
        <p id="paragraph-1">I moved back to Connecticut in June 2019. I considered law school and even took the LSAT. But the crushing cost of legal education combined with no great intrinsic desire to practice law pushed me to find something else.</p>
        <p id="paragraph-1">I came across an advertisement for the coding bootcamp at UCONN and looked into web development. It checks a lot of boxes for me. I enjoy constructing logical systems. It’s a career path that requires constant learning. The industry is booming. It will allow me to have a family someday. And similar to carpentry, it’s satisfying to finish building something and <strong>it works.</strong></p>
        <p id="paragraph-1">While I’m only beginning my coding journey, I’m exhilarated by what I’ve learned so far. Little by little I’m seeing how this world of "Elements" and "Event Listeners" allow the modern world to function. It think it’s exciting to be a part of building the internet.</p>
